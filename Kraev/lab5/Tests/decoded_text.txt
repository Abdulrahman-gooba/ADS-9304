Around 1948, both Claude E. Shannon (1948) and Robert M. Fano (1949) independently proposed two different source coding algorithms for an efficient description of a discrete memoryless source. Unfortunately, in spite of being different, both schemes became known under the same name Shannon-Fano coding. There are several reasons for this mixup. For one thing, in the discussion of his coding scheme, Shannon mentions Fano's scheme and calls it "substantially the same" (Shannon, 1948, p. 17). For another, both Shannon's and Fano's coding schemes are similar in the sense that they both are efficient, but suboptimal prefix-free coding schemes with a similar performance.
